What is a parameter?\n","  - A parameter is a fixed value that is used in model to describe a specific characteristic of a dataset or system. In data analytics, parameters helps to define the structure of a statistical or machine-learning model. For example, in a linear regression equation (y = mx + b), m (slope) and b (intercept) are parameters.\n","\n","#2. What is correlation? What does negative correlation mean?\n","  - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables—how they change together. If one of the variable increases while the other also increases, they are positively correlated. If one increases while the other decreases, they are negatively correlated. For example:\n","   * Positive correlation → More hours studied → Higher exam scores\n","   * Negative correlation → More time on social media → Lower exam scores\n","\n","\n","  - A negative correlation means that as one variable increases, the other decreases.For example:\n","    * The more you exercise, the less body fat you have.\n","    * The more discounts a company gives, the lower its profits.\n","\n","The strength of a negative correlation is measured between -1 to 0 in a correlation coefficient.\n","\n","#3. Define Machine Learning. What are the main components in Machine Learning?\n","  - Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to learn from data and make decisions without being explicitly programmed.\n","  - Main Components of Machine Learning:\n","    * Data-The foundation of ML; the more relevant the data, the better the model.\n","    * Algorithms-The set of rules that the model follows to find patterns.\n","    * Model-The system that learns from data and makes predictions.\n","    * Training-The process of feeding data into the model to help it learn.\n","    * Loss Function-measure of how well (or badly) the model is performing.\n","    * Optimization-Adjusting parameters to improve accuracy.\n","#4. How does loss value help in determining whether the model is good or not?\n","  - The loss value tells us how far off the model’s predictions are from the actual values.\n","    * High loss → Model is making many mistakes (bad model).\n","    * Low loss → Model is making fewer mistakes (good model).\n","    \n","A good model has a low loss value, meaning its predictions are close to reality.\n","\n","#5. What are continuous and categorical variables?\n","  - Continuous Variables: Variables that can take any numeric value within a range. For example: Height (170.5 cm), Weight (65.2 kg), Temperature (36.6°C)\n","  - Categorical Variables: Variables that represent categories or groups. For example: Gender (Male, Female, Other), Colors (Red, Blue, Green), Product Categories (Electronics, Clothing, Grocery)\n","\n","#6. How do we handle categorical variables in Machine Learning? What are the common techniques?\n","  - Categorical variables contain text-based data (e.g., \"Male\", \"Female\", \"Red\", \"Blue\"). Machine Learning models cannot process text, so we need to convert categorical variables into numbers.\n","  - Common techniques to handle categorical variables:\n","    * Label Encoding → Assigns a unique number to each category.For example: {Red → 0, Blue → 1, Green → 2}\n","    * One-Hot Encoding → Creates separate columns for each category and marks them with 0 or 1. For example:\n","                Color\tRed\tBlue\tGreen\n","                Red\t   1   0    \t0\n","                Blue\t 0\t 1    \t0\n","                Green\t 0 \t 0    \t1\n","    * Ordinal Encoding → Used for ranked categories (e.g., Small < Medium < Large → {Small = 1, Medium = 2, Large = 3}).\n","\n","#7. What do you mean by training and testing a dataset?\n","  - Training dataset: The data used to teach the model patterns and relationships.\n","  - Testing dataset: The data used to check if the model learned correctly by making predictions on unseen data.\n","\n","Think of it like preparing for an exam:\n","  - Studying (Training data) → Learning concepts.\n","  - Taking the exam (Testing data) → Checking if you can apply what you learned.\n","\n","#8. What is sklearn.preprocessing?\n","  - sklearn.preprocessing is a module in Python's scikit-learn library that helps clean and transform raw data into a format suitable for Machine Learning.\n","\n","#9. What is a Test set?\n","  - A test set is a portion of data used to evaluate the performance of a trained machine learning model. It helps check how well the model performs on new, unseen data.\n","\n","#10. How do we split data for model fitting (training and testing) in Python? How do you approach a Machine Learning problem?\n","1. We use the train_test_split function from sklearn.model_selection.\n","   - For example using Python:\n","              from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\n","              X = [[1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]]\n","              y = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]\n","              X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)\n","\n","2. A structured way to solve ML problems:\n","     * Understand the problem- Identify what you need to predict.\n","     * Collect and clean data- Remove missing values and duplicates.\n","     * Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)- Analyze patterns in data.\n","     * Preprocess the data- Handle categorical variables, scale numerical values.\n","     * Split data into training and test sets- Use train_test_split().\n","     * Choose a model- Decide between Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.\n","     * Train the model- Use the training set to fit the model.\n","     * Evaluate the model- Test it on the test dataset.\n","     * Optimize and fine-tune- Improve performance by adjusting parameters.\n","\n","#11. Why do we have to perform EDA before fitting a model to the data?\n","   - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) helps us:\n","     * Understand data distribution- Find missing values, outliers, and trends.\n","     * Identify relationships between variables- Use correlation analysis.\n","     * Choose the right preprocessing methods- Handle categorical and numerical data properly.\n","     * Avoid mistakes- Spot errors before training the model.\n","\n","#12. What is correlation?\n","   - Correlation shows the relationship between two variables—how they move together.\n","     * Positive correlation → When one variable increases, the other also increases. For example: More study hours → Higher marks.\n","     * Negative correlation → When one variable increases, the other decreases. For example: More junk food → Worse health.\n","\n","  - Correlation is measured between -1 to 1:\n","    * 1 → Perfect positive correlation.\n","    * 0 → No correlation.\n","    * -1 → Perfect negative correlation.\n","\n","#13.

How can you find correlation between variables in Python?\n","   - You can use Pandas and Seaborn to calculate and visualize correlation.\n","   - For example using Python:\n","                   import pandas as pd\n","                  data = {'Study_Hours': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'Exam_Scores': [50, 60, 65, 70, 80]}\n","                  df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","                  print(df.corr())\n","\n","#15. What is causation? Explain difference between correlation and causation with an example.\n","   - Causation means that one event directly causes another event to happen.\n","   - Correlation means that two variables are related but one does not necessarily cause the other.\n","   - Example:\n","      1. Correlation: Ice cream sales and drowning cases increase in summer.\n","           * (Does ice cream cause drowning? No! It is just that both happen more in hot weather.)\n","      2. Causation: Smoking leads to lung cancer.\n","           * (Smoking directly damages lungs and increases cancer risk.)\n","   - Key Difference: Correlation shows a relationship, while causation proves direct influence.\n","\n","#16. What is an Optimizer? What are different types of optimizers? Explain each with an example.\n","   - An optimizer is a function that adjusts the parameters of a Machine Learning model to minimize errors (loss function) and improve accuracy.\n","   - Types of Optimizers:\n","     1.

How does it help in Machine Learning?\n","   -  Feature Scaling standardizes data so that all variables have the same scale.

How do we perform scaling in Python?\n","   - Using sklearn.preprocessing:\n","   - Example with StandardScaler (normalizes data around mean 0 and standard deviation).\n","                    from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n","                    scaler = StandardScaler()\n","                    X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n","\n","#23.
